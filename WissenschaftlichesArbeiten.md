> An iterative, pragmatic scheme of the four points above is sometimes offered as a guideline for proceeding:
>
> 1. Define a question
> 2. Gather information and resources (observe)
> 3. Form an explanatory hypothesis
> 4. Test the hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting data in a reproducible manner
> 5. Analyze the data
> 6. Interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for a new hypothesis
> 7. Publish results
> 8. Retest (frequently done by other scientists)
>
> The iterative cycle inherent in this step-by-step method goes from point 3 to 6 and back to 3 again.
