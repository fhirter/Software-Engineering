# Cloud Computing

![w:300px](There_is_no_cloud.png)

> The entire history of software engineering is that of the rise in levels of abstraction.

-- Grady Booch

> Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
> configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly
> provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed
> of
> five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.

## Essential Characteristics:

- On-demand self-service
- Broad network access
- Resource pooling
- Rapid elasticity
- Measured service

## Service Models

---

- Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

## Deployment Models

- Private cloud
- Community cloud
- Public cloud
- Hybrid cloud

## Cloud Native Applications

- A "cloud native" application has adapted and evolved to be maximally efficient in its environment: the cloud.
- The cloud is a harsher environment than the idealistic environment of a dedicated single node system.
- In the cloud, an application becomes distributed.
- It is forced to be resilient to hardware/network unpredictability and unreliability.

(vgl. https://www.reactiveprinciples.org/cloud-native/index.html)

---

- Ensuring responsiveness and reliability in this environment is difficult.
- The applications we build after embracing this environment better match how the real world actually works.
- This provides better experiences for our users, whether humans or software.

(vgl. https://www.reactiveprinciples.org/cloud-native/index.html)

---

The constraints of the cloud environment include:

- Applications are limited in the ability to scale vertically on commodity hardware.
- All inter-service communication takes place over unreliable networks.
- You must operate under the assumption that the underlying hardware can fail or be restarted or moved at any time.
- The services need to be able to detect and manage failure of their peersâ€”including partial failures.
- Strong consistency and transactions are expensive. Because of the coordination required, it is difficult to make
  services that manage data available, performant, and scalable.

---

Therefore, a Cloud Native application is designed to leverage the cloud operating model.

It is predictable, decoupled from the infrastructure, right-sized for capacity, and enables tight collaboration between
development and operations.

It can be decomposed into loosely-coupled, independently-operating services that are resilient from failures, driven by
data, and operate intelligently across geographic regions.

---

While Cloud Native applications always have a clean separation of state and compute, there are two major classes of
Cloud Native applications: stateful and stateless.

Each class addresses and excels in a different set of use-cases; non-trivial modern Cloud Native applications are
usually a combination and composition of the two.
