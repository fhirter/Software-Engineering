# 2. Use Svelte as Frontend Framework

Date: 2022-10-30

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As we will build a rather big browser app we need to decide upon a frontend framework. Considering the usual 
suspects currently widespread (Angular, React, Vue, Svelte), Svelte seems promising. It focuses on simplicity, is 
not very opinionated and is very lightweight and fast.

## Decision

We use svelte for all frontend applications.

## Consequences

We add another dependency. Progress and adoption of svelte framework needs to be monitored.
