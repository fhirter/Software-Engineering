# 3. Use Go as Backend Language

Date: 2022-10-30

## Status

Superceded by [10. Use Node.js as Backend Language](0010-use-node-js-as-backend-language.md)

## Context

We need to decide upon a backend programming language. Go seems promising for its speed and simplicity. Community 
support for web backends is great, usage in FaaS and other serverless is possible.
Adoption seems promising.

## Decision

We use go for our backend services.

## Consequences

Go is a rather young language. Adoption needs to be monitored.
